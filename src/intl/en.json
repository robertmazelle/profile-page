    "AboutPage.mainSectionTitle": "Biography",
    "AboutPage.mainSectionContent": "My name is Robert Mazelle and I am a Software Developer. I was raised in a small village Sierpnica in Lower Silesia. I have always been curious and I wanted to know everything. I am living in Wroc≈Çaw since I began my studies in the Mechatronics field in 2014. And I LOVE this city!",
    "AboutPage.mainSectionProgrammingContent": "I found out about my passion for software development about 2 years ago, as I was about to finish my robotic control studies. In fact, I always was attracted more to the programming part of handling robots. When I realised that working in the polish automation industry means not only designing and programming robots, but also assembling them, I decided to start learning programming for real.",
    "AboutPage.mainSectionCharacterContent": "I am a quiet, calm person. I like to focus on what I am doing and I hardly ever give up. When I feel comfortable with the people around me I love to joke, make allusions, trying not to offend anyone at the same time. I am very honest and respectful, so I expect from from other people the same. Also, I have a natural intellectual curiosity and I love to learn new things all the time.",
